        <p>DROID is a software tool developed by <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" title="The National Archives Website">The National Archives</a> to perform automated batch identification of file formats. Developed by its Digital Preservation Department as part of its broader digital preservation activities, DROID is designed to meet the fundamental requirement of any digital repository to be able to identify the precise format of all stored digital objects, and to link that identification to a central registry of technical information about that format and its dependencies.</p>

<p>DROID uses internal signatures to identify and report the specific file format versions of digital files. These signatures are stored in an XML signature file, generated from information recorded in the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx" title="PRONOM Technical Registry">PRONOM technical registry</a>. New and updated signatures are regularly added to PRONOM, and DROID can be configured to automatically download updated signature files.</p>

<p>DROID is a platform-independent Java application. It can be invoked from two interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java Swing GUI</li>
<li>Command line interface</li>
</ul><p>DROID allows files and folders to be selected from a file system for identification. This file list can be saved at any point. After the identification process had been run, the results can be output in various report formats, including CSV.</p>

<h3>User requirements</h3>

<p>DROID requires Java 6 Standard Edition (SE) and should work on any platform which supports that.</p>
<p>DROID has been built and tested on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows 7 (64 bit) / Oracle Java 1.6 update 34</li>
  <li>Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) / Java 1.6.0_29-b11</li>
  <li>CentOS Linux 6 (64 bit) / Oracle Java 1.6.0 update 33</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit) / Java 1.6.0_30-b12</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DROID 6 <strong>will not</strong> function with Java 7.</p>

<h3>Code structure</h3>

<p>The DROID code base is split up into separate projects, to facilitate only using parts of the DROID code that are required, and to enhance and enforce modularity in its construction:</p>

<pre><code>droid-binary                          A maven project to package the release
droid-build-tools                     Additional files required in a release build
droid-command-line                    Command-line control over DROID
droid-container                       Container signature processing
droid-core                            Binary signature processing
droid-core-interfaces                 Resource processing &amp; format recognition
droid-export                          Export droid profiles to CSV
droid-export-interfaces               Interfaces for export of DROID profiles
droid-help                            JavaHelp for DROID
droid-parent                          Maven Parent POM for other modules
droid-report                          Reporting for DROID profiles
droid-report-interfaces               Interfaces for DROID reporting
droid-results                         Profile handling, database and filtering
droid-swing-ui                        Swing GUI control over DROID
</code></pre>

<h3>Third-party dependencies</h3>

<h3>Building DROID</h3>

<p>DROID is built using Apache Maven 3. First make sure that this is installed
and if behind a proxy, edit your Maven settings.xml file to reflect the proxy
server details. On Linux this would be ~/.m2/settings.xml.</p>

<p>Once this is complete you can use the master build file under the main DROID
project folder to build the project. This is the pom.xml that sits under
the main DROID folder containing all the sub projects. </p>

<p>Simply run, "mvn install" from the command line when in this directory and DROID
will build. Follow the Maven output to see where Maven has placed the binaries.</p>

<h3>Release Notes</h3>

<h4>DROID 6.1</h4>

<p>The largest change to DROID in this release is the addition of a 'No-profile' mode which can also be read into as a 'No Database' mode for quicker identification of resources provided to DROID for identification. The focus of the output of this mode is to provide a no-frills CSV output to form part of workflow stages in preservation systems or elsewhere. </p>

<pre><code>CLI:           - No-profile mode added to command line
               - No-profile mode standard file signature matching
               - No-profile mode container file signature matching
               - No-profile mode extension matching to pre-filter contents of folders for identification
               - CLI options reordered for usability

Unit Tests:    - Fixed to enable build on Windows/Linux

Byteseek:      - Updated to version 1.1.1
               - 'Any' bit mask bug fixed in byteseek code

Bug fixes:     - BOF/EOF bug where DROID wasn't respecting anchors as part of it's matching 
                 attempts has been fixed

Maven:         - Builds using Maven 3.0
               - Completely cleaned up build infrastructure
               - All artifacts are now published to Maven Central

Derby:         - Updated from version 10.7.1.1 to 10.8.2.2

</code></pre>
<h3>Embedding DROID</h3>
<p>DROID can now be embedded in other Java Projects as a tool. DROID Maven artifacts are available from the Maven central repository under the groupId uk.gov.nationalarchives.</p>
